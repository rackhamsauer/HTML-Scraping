Web Scraping and Data Analysis Project
This repository contains the solution for the assignment that involved web scraping data and performing analysis on the collected data. The project allowed me to explore web scraping techniques and analyze the data using various data manipulation methods.

Overview
In this project, I performed web scraping to collect data from a specified website and then analyzed it. The main steps included:

Web Scraping:
I used Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests to scrape data from the web. The data was collected and stored for further analysis.

Data Analysis:
After collecting the data, I performed various groupby operations to organize and summarize the data. This was essential for understanding patterns and trends in the scraped dataset.

Data Visualization:
I created plots to visualize the findings. These visualizations helped to better understand the data and identify important insights.
The plots were the most challenging aspect, as it required multiple groupby operations to organize the data properly before plotting.

Tools and Resources Used

Python for web scraping and data manipulation.
BeautifulSoup for web scraping.
Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib/Seaborn for creating plots and visualizations.
Stack Overflow, ChatGPT, and Previous Assignments for guidance and troubleshooting during the project.
Key Insights

The web scraping process allowed me to gather a significant amount of data for analysis, and the challenge was in transforming that raw data into usable insights.
Groupby operations in Pandas were essential to summarizing the data and preparing it for visualization.
The hardest part of the project was creating the plots since it required careful organization of the data to make the visualizations meaningful.
How to Use

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python and required libraries installed, such as BeautifulSoup, requests, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
Run the Python script to scrape the data and perform the analysis.
View the generated plots to explore the findings.
Conclusion

This project was a fun and educational experience, allowing me to dive into web scraping and data analysis. The toughest part was organizing the data properly to create meaningful plots, but with the help of groupby and a bit of troubleshooting, I was able to overcome the challenges and generate useful visualizations.
